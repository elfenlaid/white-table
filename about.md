Hello, I'm Egor. During day I'm usual programmer, but at night I'm still a usual programmer. Here I'm ranting about iOS, Elixir and about how life is unfair. Mostly about first two topics I should say.

You can find me at [twitter](https://twitter.com/elfenlaid).

Opinions are my own and not the views of my employer and should never be taken seriously either.
